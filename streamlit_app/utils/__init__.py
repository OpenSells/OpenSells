"""Utility helpers for the Streamlit frontend.

All constants, functions and classes should be imported from their
dedicated submodules, e.g.::

    from streamlit_app.utils.constants import BRAND
    from streamlit_app.utils.nav import go

This ``__init__`` intentionally exposes no additional symbols to avoid
import-time side effects and circular dependencies.
